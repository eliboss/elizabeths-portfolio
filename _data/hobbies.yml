- name: Making fancy coffee! I love to make pour-overs or espresso at home. I like to know where my coffee comes from and try all the different roasts. My favorite brand is Kahawa1893.com They have beautiful coffee and a beautiful mission.

- name: Coding is for fun, not just work! Currently, I am working on my Python skills, learning new libraries and applications. I also gained access to OpenAI's GPT-3, which I hope to use in my projects after I have played around with it more.

- name: I like to cook, but baking is sweeter! During the holidays I always make cheesecake for my family. The image on the front of this card is a cake I made for my partner's birthday.

- name: I also love to watch Twitch. I try to be attentive to politics, so Hasanabi is my go-to during the day. But I also love WillNeff and Trihex. Every once in a while I watch a CSGO tournament.
