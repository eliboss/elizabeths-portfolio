- name: Coding is for fun, not just work! Currently, I am working on my Python skills, learning new libraries and applications. I also just gained access to Open AI's GPT-3, which I hope to use in my WmnsRights project after I have played around with it some more.

- name: I like to cook, but baking is sweeter! During the holidays I always make cheesecake for my family. The image on the front of this card is a cake I made for my partner's birthday.

- name: I also love to watch Twitch. I try to be attentive to politics, so Hasanabi is my go-to during the day. But I also love WillNeff and Trihex. Every once in a while my partner and I watch a CSGO tournament.
