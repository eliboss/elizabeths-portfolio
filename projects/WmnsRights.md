## Inspiration

When people know their rights, they can better advocate for themselves. The goal is to empower people who experience discrimination or a violation of their rights with knowledge so that they can fight back.

## What it does

A search app to help womxn understand and exercise their rights. Currently it is just a basic text search to look for keywords in a document in a simple UI.

## How we built it

The code is written in Java using swift for the UI and jsoup for when I add the scraping functionality

## Challenge we ran into

I don't like swift's look so I am looking to use javaFX or switch to a completely different language.
