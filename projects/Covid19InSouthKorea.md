## Inspiration

We made this program in March of 2020, before we knew a lot about Covid 19. We wanted to know what factors would impact the spread in a population in a country that had strict restrictions and a high rate of testing. The South Korean government   had been testing a lot of people and had a great dataset available, so we went with it.

## What it does

The program analyzes a dataset and displays a window to the user. The user can use various drop-down menus and text-boxes to explore the data based on age, gender, income, location, etc. There are also options for generating and displaying graphs to the user based on information they input.

## How we built it

We used Java, Swift and jsoup.

## Challenge we ran into

The data was pretty messy (as always) and this was one of the first projects that my partners and I had worked on data parsing, so it took us time to get that working.
